# Wireframes / storyboards

Setup: Let me show you some reality

•	There are now hundreds of LLMs that have been released since the emergence of ChatGPT in 2022

•	There is weekly news of record breaking benchmarks and new offerings (show 2024-2025)

•	We will take a look at only the most recent cutting edge models 

•	Four of the top companies (Meta, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic) each have dozens of available model that can specialize in certain tasks

•	There are other AI companies too, but these are the most common in the US 

Conflict: Here is something that happened to that reality

•	With so many options it can be dizzying to figure out which one to use

•	It is hard to identify which best fits my use case (coding, writing, etc)

•	Some models are very energy intensive too, so I want to choose ethically

Resolution: Here is the new reality after the conflict 

•	By segmenting the models by task type you can more clearly narrow down your choice to one model for that task

•	If you want a free open source option you should go with Meta

•	If you want to just use one model, you can choose Gemini Pro 2.5 which does it all

# User research 

## Target audience
College and Graduate students who regularly use AI to help with school work and personal projects.  These users may only have a surface level understanding of how Large Language Models (LLMs) work, but do not have the time to learn more about each one.  The audience member may have a background in Computer Science or Public Policy so I will create a narrative that allows each stakeholder to choose the LLM that ethically aligns best with their workflow, both for performance and sustainability.

## Interview script

I want to know if my original idea about tying model choice to high costs and diminishing performance return is interesting or if I should pivot.  I may want to create a story about assisting students in choosing a model in the sea of options.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Does the narrative about cost matter to students?    |       Do you care if companies/investors are wasting their money on LLM development, or do you believe that does not impact your own life?           |
|   Building trust   |          Does my narrative fairly represent both the potential and the limitations of the major LLM providers, or do you feel any bias toward certain companies?        |
|    Relevant information  |  Would you just go with the best benchmarked model or would you want something more tailored to your needs?                |


## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1 Woman, 30’s, Teacher | Interview 2 Woman, 20’s, MEAM student | Interview 3 Man, 60’s, My boss|
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do you care if companies/investors are wasting their money on LLM development, or do you believe that does not impact your own life?  | Who is paying for these? Me on my phone or a big company using it?     |   the storyline about investors wasting money isn’t compelling for students. Most people won’t care that they waste money.  |  If you gave this at work we would just want to know more about the API costs     |
| Does my narrative fairly represent both the potential and the limitations of the major LLM providers, or do you feel any bias toward certain companies?          |    I only know Chat GPT and don’t know how to find these other ones            |    Just focus on a few models per company    |    Why only the 5 companies? What about others I’ve heard of? |  
| Would you just go with the best benchmarked model or would you want something more tailored to your needs?|      | I’ll take that survey because I only need AI for brainstorming |     It’s good that you have CS focus and general purpose AI suggestions    |    I’m surprised the open source models are almost as good as the paid             |


# Identified changes for Part III
For part 3 I will be changing my narrative.  Clearly the students do not care if these companies and investors are pouring billions into AI development rather than other ventures.  People are also not highly interested in the details of how a model is built but rather the practical usage of them in their lives.  I will focus on helping them choose the best model.  I intend to be specific enough with the use case so they can get the maximum benefit.  The energy efficiency did not seem to sway the crowd.  I will abandon this as a central part of the narrative but may include a few words on the energy efficiency of a recommended model.
