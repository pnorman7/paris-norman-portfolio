# Outline

In the past five years we have witnessed unprecedented growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Since ChatGPT's emergence, AI has transformed from a specialized field into a globally accessible technology. This has driven massive demand but also revealed significant environmental and financial costs.

AI model training historically has required enormous computing resources and potentially costing hundreds of millions of dollars. This is alongside substantial environmental impacts. Once deployed, data centers processing user queries continue to generate significant environmental and financial ongoing costs. Finally there is tight control over the AI landscape which remains concentrated among a few resource-rich companies: OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Anthropic.  There are other companies such as DeepSeek, but I will plan to focus on American AI for the US audience. 

In my project I would like to help tell a story for how a user can responsibly and ethically navigate the many AI offerings to decide what the best one is from an environmental and cost efficiency perspective.  There are many large powerful LLMs, but they also coincide with a large environmental and financial cost to the user.  I challenge if these models are needed, or if users can work with cheaper more energy efficient models to get similar outcomes.  I want to challenge the notion that bigger is better and put brakes on the AI race that appears to have marginally diminishing returns as each new AI model is released.

I will walk through the narrative introducing the rise of LLMs like ChatGPT in 2021 and begin with an excited story arc explaining how they can be incredibly helpful in personal and professional life in 2025.  I will then start to tell a more detailed story of how they are developed which begins to touch on the negatives of AI models such as environmental impact and cost to train them.  I will continue into a more sobering story explaining that only a few companies control the entire market and regulation is needed. I will begin to change the tone to a more hopeful one by explaining that some models are more ethically developed and used than others.  I will tell the story that each person can influence how these companies do business through the power they wield as consumers to the model they choose.  I will finish by telling the user to take a quiz that will point them to the model that most closely aligns with their views. I hope through the duration of my story audience members understand some of the unseen effects AI has.  I then want them to see through clear comparisons that they have a menu of options, and of that menu some models are powerful, more ethically responsible, and sustainable.  It is my hope that during the quiz audience members would be persuaded to use these AI models.

# The data

I will use the llm_comparison_dataset.csv to visualize the significant differences in energy efficiency and cost between AI models. By visualizing energy efficiency ratings alongside price per million tokens and benchmark scores, I'll hope to show that many mid-tier and low cost models achieve 80% or so of flagship capabilities while using substantially less energy and costing much less.  I want to clearly demonstrate the diminishing returns of increasingly powerful models.  This ties into the idea that “bigger is not always better”.
I will create visualizations exploring the relationship between performance benchmark and resource consumption for specific tasks (ex. Coding, experiments, or simple text editing) allowing users to identify what is the optimal model for their specific use cases. By highlighting "sweet spot" models I will provide concrete evidence that environmentally and financially responsible choices don't require significant performance sacrifices.
