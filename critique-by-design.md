# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

## Step four: Test the solution

Questions to the critics:

- Do you understand immediately what this is showing?

- Do you prefer to see the nations color coded in the bars?

- Are the X-axis labels legible or should they be slanted?

- Should I write the column total on each bar?

- I have white space in the top right.  Should I write insights there?

Results: 

Feedback 1
Supervisor at work, man in his 60’s

- 	The title font reminds me of Jurassic Park 
- 	Some of these plants have really long names.  Some get cutoff.  
- 	It looks like the US has a long way to catch up.
-  Iwonder why India and China are so strong in solar.
-  like the light to dark orange affect.  The last couple plants are red hot.  

Feedback 2
Wife, woman in her 30s, teacher

-   I have to turn my head to read the names of the plants, and they’re faint.
- 	The flags are a nice touch
-   Can you explain what is being measured? I can’t tell right away.  Is it the area size?
-   Maybe group by East and West?  It looks like India and China are leading and US and Mexico are way behind.

Classmates Feedback
Two men and one woman in their 20’s.  

-  Can you explain what is being measured, maybe in the subtitle?
-  You should turn the bar graph sideways.  That way the names of the plants are oriented correctly, not vertically.
-  Maybe group by East and West.
-  I would like to know the country totals to really see who the leader is.
-   he Y and X axis labels are grey and faint.  Hard to see at a glance.
-   You can remove “The” from the title.
-   I like the orange gradient.  It gives a heat feeling.  


Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

My final visualization integrated extensive feedback.  I selected the title "20 Largest Solar Power Plants Powering Our Future" to emphasize the positive global progress in solar energy. Upon peer recommendation, I included a clarifying subtitle, "By Measuring their enormous megawatt peak capacity," explicitly addressing previous confusion that viewers had interpreted "largest" as referencing physical area rather than production capacity. I also used a font that appeared "Futuristic" which emphisizes the story that they plants are powering the future or are somewhat high-tech.  I deliberately did not choose a classic clean corporate font because I want to trigger the viewers imagination of a future unlike today powered by solar energy.  

Transitioning to a horizontal bar chart resolved multiple design issues. The original vertical orientation led to problematic white space and vertical cutoff plant names. By shifting horizontally, plant names became  legible and the overall layout balanced. I was able to improve readability by shortening names by removing the repetitive "Solar Power Plant" added to the name of almost every site. This gave much more room on the axis and reduced redundancy and unnecessary length. Flag emojis were uniformly placed at the end of each plant name,  highlighting the national investment and world leaders in solar power generation.  Some critics asked to have a better understanding of "who is number one" and this is one way to quickly see which nation has the largest capacity, but also most plants.

I  chose an orange-to-red gradient for the bars to correlate  with the solar theme and symbolizing the increasing power output of the plants. Sorting bars in descending order of megawatt capacity reinforced the narrative of significant growth in renewable energy. Darkened axis text significantly improved legibility, and adding  megawatt totals at the end of each bar enabled viewers to quickly interpret capacity without tracing bars visually across the chart.

These adjustments greatly simplified the original visualization while retaining all critical information: plant names, nation, and megawatt capacities. By reducing visual noise and thoughtfully incorporating feedback, the final chart effectively communicates global progress in solar energy production.
_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
