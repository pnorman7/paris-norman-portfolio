# Title
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

Second Draft: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4402c094-5b81-4964-89ff-30dc2f8e977b)

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Do you understand immediately what this is showing?

- Do you prefer to see the nations color coded in the bars?

- Are the X-axis labels legible or should they be slanted?

- Should I write the column total on each bar?

- I have white space in the top right.  Should I write insights there?

Results: 

Feedback 1
Supervisor at work, man in his 60’s
•	The title font reminds me of Jurassic Park 
•	Some of these plants have really long names.  Some get cutoff.  
•	It looks like the US has a long way to catch up.
•	I wonder why India and China are so strong in solar.
•	I like the light to dark orange affect.  The last couple plants are red hot.  

Feedback 2
Wife, woman in her 30s, teacher
•	I have to turn my head to read the names of the plants, and they’re faint.
•	The flags are a nice touch
•	Can you explain what is being measured? I can’t tell right away.  Is it the area size?
•	Maybe group by East and West?  It looks like India and China are leading and US and Mexico are way behind.

Classmates Feedback
Two men and one woman in their 20’s.  
•	Can you explain what is being measured, maybe in the subtitle?
•	You should turn the bar graph sideways.  That way the names of the plants are oriented correctly, not vertically.
•	Maybe group by East and West.
•	I would like to know the country totals to really see who the leader is.
•	The Y and X axis labels are grey and faint.  Hard to see at a glance.  
•	You can remove “The” from the title.
•	I like the orange gradient.  It gives a heat feeling.  


Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
