# Changes made since Part II

For my final Shorthand presentation, I made design changes based on feedback from my peers and interviewees.  I made a large pivot in the story which was originally about the energy and sustainability downfalls of large language models with the goal of helping the audience find the most energy efficient and helpful model.  Part of this story was about the high costs of running them both for the user and for the companies building them.  I received feedback that this story line is not interesting for students and in fact most people would be happy to hear that these companies are not getting a return on their investment.  I knew I had to create a story that the audience would feel they are benefiting from at the end of the day, so I decided to make a narrative about cutting through the dense AI news to deliver them the best models tailored to their needs. 
I wanted to deliver an “awards show” of sorts that allowed the student audience members to clearly see the top models in an array of categories.  Knowing some students need a model to support coding while others use LLMs for writing and research I was able to create my charts and break out this data.  I first gave an overall group award to the 13 best models that benchmarked over 1000 score.  I chose this number to drastically cut down the field of models from 70 to only 13.  This is more digestible for the audience and does not create a crowded chart.  

Next, I showed the Coding Kings and the Business and Writing Titans.  This was a way of making a “podium” for their categories where the audience knows they are so close that they can choose any of them and be satisfied.  Finally, I called out the very best model that had the highest benchmark score and excelled in all tasks.  I was able to use an alluvial diagram that called out each of the tasks sorted by category.  This gives the audience a clear breakdown of why the Google model was so powerful.  Conveniently Google announced Gemini 2.5 Pro is free to students through July 2026 and I decided to use this as my call to action by directing them to a powerful tool they can actually make use of at the conclusion of my presentation.   

## The audience


The intended audience for my presentation will be graduate students that are willing to use LLMs for project work, but may not have the time to keep up with all of the AI developments.  These users may have not have heard of some foreign companies, so I wanted to focus only on the top American companies so that there was some familiarity.  At the end of the story I wanted to make it simple enough for them to pick from a few models rather than the dozens of models that are in circulation.  I intentionally want to stay out of the weeds of LLM development to avoid boring or confusing the crowd.  I picture the crowd as surface level users simply looking to benefit from LLM tools.  

## Final design decisions

Some design decisions I made were highlighting certain phrases in the story build up like "70 Large Language Models" and "graduate students" to quickly tell the story especially when text is scrolling quickly.  I also used grey as my friend when isolating Google as the most energy efficient company compared to peers.  I used a colorful friendly pallet of vibrant blues, greens, and white to help set the mood as AI being an upbeat beneficial tool for students. Together I wanted the story to be a funnel from a wide net of options down to a pinpointed single model giving them the feeling that they just saved days of research and have an answer.

## AI acknowledgements
I used AI to help troubleshoot Tableau and Shorthand. If I got stuck I would take a screenshot and have Claude walk me through the process. For example, Claude could show me how to embed charts in certain areas which I struggled with at first and only was able to paste jpeg chart images. 

# Final thoughts
Shorthand is a beautiful tool for journalists and those looking to tell an immersive story.  I struggled to use it to its full capability because I did not have beautiful photos and images related to my topic so I was limited to the stock library.  I think my story could have been more compelling if I had the creative time to take and include original photos.
